# How Regex does Password Validation

## Summary
In this tutorial, I'll break down a regular exression (regex) used for password validatins. This regex makes sure that the password is strong and secure by checking for length, uppercase and lowercase letters,digits and special characters.

The regex pattern we will break down in this tutorial is:
^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$
