# How Regex does Password Validation

## Summary
In this tutorial, I'll break down a regular exression (regex) used for password validatins. This regex makes sure that the password is strong and secure by checking for length, uppercase and lowercase letters,digits and special characters.

The regex pattern we will break down in this tutorial is:
^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$

## Regex Components

### Anchors
The regex begins with ^ and ends with $. these are known as anchors:

The ^ anchor is used to assert the position at the start of a string

The $ anchor is used to assert the position at the end of a string

EXAMPLES
Matches: Password123!
Doesn't Match:  Password123!(extra space makes if fail)

### Quantifiers
The {8,} quantifer specifies that the preceding character class must occur at least 8 times 

{8,}: this makes sure that the password has at least 8 characters.

EXAMPLES:
Matches: Password1!,AbCdE123!
Doesn't Match: Sab1!

### Character Classes
The character class [A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&] defines what characters are allowed in the password.

A-Za-Z: Is used to match uppercase and lowercase letters.
/d: Is used to match any single digit.
@$!%*?&: Is used to match the specitfied special character.

This makes sure the password can only have letters, digits, and specified special characters.

EXAMPLES:
Matches: Password1!,AbCdE123!
Doesn't Match: Sab/enri1 

### Flags
Flags are optional. The are modifiers that change how the pattern is read. They can control things like case sensitivity, multiline matching and globle search.

EXAMPLES
i(ignore case):makes so the pattern is case-insensitive.
m(multiline): Treats beginning ^ and ending $ anchors as working across multiple lines in the input string.
g(global search): maskes it so it searches for all matches in the input string, not just the first.

### Bracket Expressions
Barcket expressions are used to define a set of characters for matching. They can support character ranges, negation and can be used with other elements of regex for more flexible and powerful pattern matching. 

(?=.*[a-z]): Makes it so that there needs to be at least one lowercase letter.
(?=.*[A-Z]): Makes it so that there needs to be at least one uppercase letter.
(?=.*\d): Makes it so that there needs to be at least one digit.
(?=.*[@#$%&]): Makes it so that there needs to be at least one special character.
[A-Za-z\d@#$%&]{8,}: The allowed characters, repeated at least 8 times.

EXAMPLES 
Matches: Password1!,AbCdE123!
Doesn't Match: password, sab123

### Boundaries
Boundaries are used for defining specific locations where patterns should be matching. The differnt type of boundaries are word line boundaries and string boundaries. This is used for creating more precise and controlled regex patterns. 

 word boundaries (\b, \B).
  line boundaries (^, $)  
  string boundaries (\A, \Z, \z)

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Positive Lookahead is used to assert that a pattern exists ahead in the string without consuming characters. The format is (?=...).

(?=.*[a-z]): Makes it so that there needs to be at least one lowercase letter.
(?=.*[A-Z]): Makes it so that there needs to be at least one uppercase letter.
(?=.*\d): Makes it so that there needs to be at least one digit.
(?=.*[@#$%&]): Makes it so that there needs to be at least one special character.
[A-Za-z\d@#$%&]{8,}: The allowed characters, repeated at least 8 times.


EXAMPLES 
Matches: a, A, 1, !
Doesn't Match: (empty string)
